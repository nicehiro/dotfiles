description: Simulate peer review to find weaknesses before submission
---
Review the following as a rigorous peer reviewer for a top-tier venue. Review from multiple perspectives:

**Skeptical Expert**: Are claims supported by experiments? Are there theoretical gaps? Is the method actually novel?
**Methodology Purist**: Are baselines fair and up-to-date? Proper statistical analysis? Sufficient ablations?
**Clarity Advocate**: Can a PhD student in the field follow this? Are figures informative? Is notation consistent?
**Impact Questioner**: Would practitioners use this? What's the real delta over existing methods?

Structure your review as:

### Summary (2-3 sentences)

### Ratings
| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Novelty | | |
| Technical Quality | | |
| Clarity | | |
| Significance | | |

### Major Concerns (up to 3)
Potential rejection reasons. For each: what's the problem, why it matters, how to fix it.

### Minor Issues (3-5)
Easy fixes that should be addressed.

### Missing Elements
Experiments, baselines, or analyses that would strengthen claims.

### Questions for Authors

### Verdict
Recommendation (Accept / Weak Accept / Borderline / Weak Reject / Reject), confidence level, and one paragraph summary with path to acceptance.
