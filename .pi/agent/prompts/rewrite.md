description: Rewrite a LaTeX paragraph for clarity and concision
---
Revise the following academic prose. Read the full passage before changing anything. Understand what the author is trying to say, then help them say it better.

Make the minimum changes needed. Do not rewrite prose that already works. Preserve the author's word choices when they are effective.

For each change, show:

Original: [the original text]
Revised: [improved version]
Reason: [one sentence explaining why]

Fix these categories:
- Unclear sentences: simplify, split compounds, replace ambiguous pronouns with specific nouns
- Vague claims: add specifics, numbers, dataset names
- Weak verbs: "is able to" → "can", "makes use of" → "uses", "carries out" → "performs"
- Empty phrases: cut "it is worth noting that", "in order to" → "to", "the fact that"
- Poor flow: add bridging sentences, reorder if needed
- Formatting: convert any bullet points, em-dashes, or parenthetical asides into flowing prose

After all changes, provide the complete revised passage.
